The objective of the *PI2P* project is to contribute to a better understanding of the response of insects to environmental factors in the context of global warming. More particularly, the project is interested in the development of insects and phenology. To reach the objective, we develop phenological models and improve their performance by providing parameter estimates calibrated from field insect monitoring and taking into account agroecosystems parameters. To build models, we need data on insects, but also data on the environmental conditions experienced by insects in the fields. That is why we are monitoring both the climate and insects.

All the data is gathered in the [PI2P website](https://pi2p.ird.fr) in a postgreSQL database together with its RESTfull API developed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) JavaScript runtime and [express](https://expressjs.com/) web application framework.

This companion website describes the hardware and software to document and contribute to the *PI2P* project within two sections. The first section is dedicated to the climate and the second section to the insects.

Welcome aboard and please contact us for any information.
