Welcome to Titouan. Titouan was in our lab from 2020-04-14 to 2020-07-24 as a IUT student (GEII Cachan ; Paris Saclay University):

*1. Insect crop pests are responsible for many crop losses. The fight against these insects plays a central role in the food security for the populations, it is therefore important to build models to predict the phenology of these insects in order to intervene at the right time.*

*2. Some information is available through weather stations, but they are not sufficient: a finer resolution is necessary for studying local conditions. In particular, the plant cover greatly influences the values ​​of temperature, relative humidity, and the brightness perceived by insects.*

*3. The project aims to develop local units, based on a microcontroller, to measure various parameters of the conditions experimented by insects. These local units communicate with a server for further data analysis.*

*4. The components necessary for the realization of the project represent less than 20€, also offering the transmission of data to the server. This lower cost, in addition to increased flexibility, allows measuring conditions associated with a micro-environment, leaving a much finer resolution for studying insects.*

*5. In view of the wide availability of these components today, and given the ease of assembly of the card, requiring no qualification particularly, these terrain sensors will see an increase importance in the coming years.*

*6. In parallel, a server allowing the centralization of data is proposed, in order to allow a study on a larger scale and on different continents of insect pests.*
