Welcome to Lucas. Lucas was in our lab from 2021-04-19 to 2021-06-29 as a IUT student (GEII Cachan ; Paris Saclay University):

*The fight against insect pests is an important issue worldwide due to crop losses, and more particularly in developing countries. Studying the  life cycle of these insects may allow new control strategies to be implemented. To do this, it is necessary to measure the climatic variables and their variations in time and space. Weather stations are already present in many countries but they do not allow a measurement of the variables experienced by the insects. The objective of this internship is to design a simple device that measures the values ​​of climatic variables and sends them to a server. It must be able to be deployed by people not specialized in electronics in the project intervention countries. The device developed is composed of an ESP32 type microcontroller connected to sensors (BME680 for temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure; SI1145 for light radiation; DS18B20 for a complementary measurement of the temperature). The data is sent to the server API via POST requests using the built-in wifi card of the ESP32. The device is powered through a panel solar associated with a battery. A box made by 3D printing ensures the device protection.*
