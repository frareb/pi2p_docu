Welcome to Aghiles. Aghiles was in our lab from 2020-03-13 to 2020-08-31 as a Master2 student (E3A Mobile Automatic Systems ; Evry and Paris Saclay University):

*As part of the Master 2 mention Automatic Mobile Systems, at the University of Evry Val d’Essonne, Paris-Saclay, I had the opportunity to do a Six-month internship in the EGCE research laboratory at Gif-Sur-Yvette. The objective of my internship is to create a network of sensors connected to the agricultural scale. Going through the choice of the most suitable sensors for the project and the design of a wind speed sensor closest to a professional anemometer.*
